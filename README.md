# Trophy 151 Calculator
This is a quick and dirty PowerShell script I cobbled together to count how many Eldritch Tentacles have been fought (**not necessarily beaten**) during a manually-defined set of session logs, mainly for the purpose of obtaining [Trophy Number 151](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Tentacle_Tickler).

To actually earn the trophy, you must **defeat** [some number of] [Eldritch Tentacles](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Eldritch_Tentacle) during a single ascension.
